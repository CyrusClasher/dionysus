# Dionysus

Dionysus is a powerful SaaS application that enables users to index and analyze all files present in a GitHub repository using AI. It provides detailed insights, commit summaries, and AI-driven responses to repository-related queries. Additionally, users can upload meeting recordings to extract key insights, all while leveraging Stripe for credit-based access to its features.

## Features

### üîç GitHub Repository Indexing & Analysis
- Index all files in a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.
- AI-powered file analysis using GeminiAPI.
- Retrieve summaries of all commits made to the repository.

### üõ† Custom Hooks for Enhanced Functionality
- **`useProject`**: Manages and provides project-related data within a React component, leveraging React hooks and local storage.
- **`useRefetch`**: Dynamically refetches active queries using React Query's `useQueryClient` to update the UI without needing a page refresh.

### üí° AI-Powered Repository Q&A
- Users can ask questions about the repository.
- Queries are transformed into vector embeddings.
- The system retrieves the top 10 most relevant files based on the question vector.
- AI provides responses along with files that need modifications.
- Users can save AI-generated answers for later reference.

### üìÇ Meeting Analysis & AI Insights
- Users can upload meeting recordings via Google Firebase Storage.
- AI processes the recordings using Assembly AI to generate summaries, extract key points, and identify potential issues.

### üí≥ Stripe-Integrated Credit System
- Users can purchase credits (50 credits = $1) via Stripe.
- Each GitHub file indexing operation consumes 1 credit.
